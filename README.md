## Problem Definition

As a data engineerig/analytics contractor, we have been approached by a new retailer store company that lack a solution for storing and analyzing their sales data. They want us to help them build an end-to-end solution around their data set, and to assist in analyzing and optimizing their data. 

Our plan is to create a data warehouse around their data, and to then build an analytics solution on top, providing actionable insights that will help the company understand trends, identify key opportunities, enhance their sales strategies for sustained growth and success, make data-informed decisions, and improve overall business performance.

## Action Plan

We will be employing the following technologies within this project:

1. __Apache Ariflow__ - Pipeline orchestration 

2. __Terraform__ - Deployment of cloud infrastructure

3. __Google Cloud Storage__ - Raw data storage

4. __Google BigQuery__ - Data warehousing

5. __dbt__ - Data warehouse modeling

6. __Looker Studio__ - Data visualization
